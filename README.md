# Estadistica inferencial R

This repository is the history of my work as a Biologist student as well as a professor of biostatistics in the Faculty of Science, UNAM.
For mi classes, I develop some basic functions to have more graphical explanations and work keys for the homework.
Furthermore, for my colleagues and friends who I helped with his works, I created some scripts for punctual statistical analysis.


All this work is on this site.
